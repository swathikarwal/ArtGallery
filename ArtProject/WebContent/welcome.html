		<p>This is about my art. Art is a diverse range of human
			activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts
			(artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill,
			intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.In
			their most general form these activities include the production of
			works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art,
			and the aesthetic dissemination of art. The oldest documented forms
			of art are visual arts, which include creation of images or objects
			in fields including today painting, sculpture, printmaking,
			photography, and other visual media. Architecture is often included
			as one of the visual arts; however, like the decorative arts, or
			advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical
			considerations of use are essentialâ€”in a way that they usually are
			not in a painting, for example. Music,theatre, film, dance, and other
			performing arts, as well as literature and other media such as
			interactive media, are included in a broader definition of art or the
			arts. Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery
			and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage
			after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount,
			the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in
			general, such as the decorative or applied arts.</p>

		<p>The term contemporary art gallery refers usually to a privately
			owned for-profit commercial gallery. These galleries are often found
			clustered together in large urban centers. Smaller cities are usually
			home to at least one gallery, but they may also be found in towns or
			villages, and remote areas where artists congregate, e.g. the Taos
			art colony and St Ives, Cornwall. Contemporary art galleries are
			usually open to the general public without charge; however, some are
			semi-private. They usually profit by taking a portion of art sales;
			from 25% to 50% is typical. There are also many non-profit or
			collective galleries. Some galleries in cities like Tokyo charge the
			artists a flat rate per day, though this is considered distasteful in
			some international art markets. Galleries often hang solo shows.
			Curators often create group shows that say something about a certain
			theme, trend in art, or group of associated artists. Galleries
			sometimes choose to represent artists exclusively, giving them the
			opportunity to show regularly. A gallery's definition can also
			include the artist cooperative or artist-run space, which often (in
			North America and Western Europe) operates as a space with a more
			democratic mission and selection process. Such galleries typically
			have a board of directors and a volunteer or paid support staff that
			select and curate shows by committee, or some kind of similar process
			to choose art that typically lacks commercial ends.</p>
